Through smart technology and innovative design, we strive to create convenience and surprises, providing fast, thoughtful, and diverse shopping experiences.

Our mission addresses the 


issue of the "lying flat" culture among the younger generation in Hong Kong. We aspire for Door Anywhere to provide entrepreneurial opportunities and a platform for young people to showcase their creativity in product design, AI systems, and logistics operations. By establishing a presence in various enterprises, universities, and colleges, we aim to broaden our brand reach and create more possibilities for the youth.

## Our Services Page (我們的服務):
This page will detail the various vending machine types offered by Door Anywhere. These include ambient temperature vending machines for snacks, instant food, daily necessities, and gifts; refrigerated vending machines (with lift platforms) for instant food, heated food, beverages, and dairy products; and frozen vending machines (with lift platforms) for heated food and ice cream. Additionally, we offer pull-door cabinet types, freshly ground coffee machines, ice cream & popsicle machines, and themed gashapon machines.

Our advantages lie in product diversification, offering a wide range of goods tailored to different locations and customer needs, including halal food, sweets, daily necessities, stationery, teaching aids, souvenirs, and gifts. We also provide customized services, creating tailor-made product lists for brands and offering a professional product design team for exclusive product manufacturing without requiring mass production. Furthermore, we integrate offline promotions through our self-operated farm and a physical store in Tsim Sha Tsui, attracting potential customers for offline engagement and organizing various promotional activities such as staff sales, markets, themed parties, family activity days, and festive celebrations.

We highlight three major features: the introduction of Singapore's largest healthy meal box brand, Chef-in-Box, which offers halal-certified world cuisine by renowned chefs; our Halal Meal Box Machine, catering to multicultural needs and placed in universities and institutions, featuring our own brand "味來速遞" (Taste Express) halal meal boxes and soup packs; and our pioneering Ice Cream & Popsicle Machine.
